# multicountry_mapping

I was trying to figure out how to map multiple countries on a single plot using the data from the GLobal Administrative Areas Database (http://www.gadm.org/).  I cam accross this on SO: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5126745/gadm-maps-cross-country-comparision-graphics but couldn't get it to work. Tweeps hunted into it and found that the connectin to downloading GADM files direct from the web no longer worked. It turns out Jamie Ashander posted a fix https://gist.github.com/ashander/e7da5e58676656eb6a69.  I had to do some modifications to get it to work, but it's up and running now.
